This document contains requirements and information regarding
contributing to the taskpp project. Our main repository is located at
https://gitlab.com/kevr2d2/taskpp, where merge requests and issues
should be filed.

Code style
----------

- Code should be formatted using clang-format
- Code should be linted using clang-tidy
- `UpperCase` for types
- `snake_case` for functions and variables
- `ALL_CAPS_UNDERLINED` for global constants
- Try to avoid using globals and heavily coupled implementations

`scripts/tidy.py` is a Python3 script with no dependencies which runs
clang-tidy in parallel on up to `multiprocessing.cpu_count()` threads.

Meaningful merges
-----------------

To get code merged into the project, ensure that your patchset provides a
meaningful change to the project. We will not accept any dead code or
opinionated changes.

Within a patchset, developers should logically separate the additions or
changes contributed, and they should achieve a particular job.

That being said, we encourage generic and reusable code where possible. This
will allow us to keep a cleaner codebase over time, but, do not over-generalize
over simplicity; of course, this always depends on the biproduct of the
generalization and any complex changes should be discussed

Test coverage
-------------

Any code committing in this project **requires** that the developer provide
tests which produce 100% coverage over the source code added or modified.

To test code in the project, read the TESTING document.
